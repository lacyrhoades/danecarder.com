Hi Dane - it's Alice Rothman, better known as Jacob's mom from Easter
Seals. I hope the girls are doing well. Jacob gave Violet's name as a
word for V week in his preK class last week! I can't believe they will
be in kindergarten this fall!!

=20

Anyway, we are in need of some paint work around our home and I wondered
if you might be willing to take a look. Externally the trim needs
painting (brick home with just a little wood trim). Internally, we are
considering whether to try to sell the house to buy back to something
with more character while the market is still good. So we need to look
at touching up or painting inside too. There are some areas of faux
finish that I hope could be touched up, else we'll need to paint them.=20

=20

Would you be willing to take a look and give me an estimate?

Thanks,

Alice Rothman
