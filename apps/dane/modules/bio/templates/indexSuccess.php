	<p><strong>Ghosts and Hopes</strong></p>
	<p>This body of work is not about the Civil War. It is about an emotion: the layered, all-encompassing emotion that accompanies a life lived. It is about being passionate enough to fight, compassionate enough to grieve, honest enough to be open.  It is about ghosts and hopes.</p>
	<p>I began these paintings because I was in awe of the imagery.  Instantly, I knew that there was a Higher cause for my foray into this subject matter. When I was sixteen years old, my father passed away, and since then I have felt an unflinching familiarity with the Spiritual.  Ghosts and hopes have been the raw material that I have worked with in art for over fifteen years.  It was in rediscovering Civil War imagery that my creative voice found volume and a proper vehicle to express the depths of this Spiritual life.</p>
	<p>Living in a time of war, and creating art as a necessity leads me to make such paintings.  With the use of old images, I am subtly seeking to connect the war of yore to those that are fought today.  I believe that all war is civil war, brothers fighting brothers.  When we kill, we kill our Spiritual kin.  It is grey, dreary, somber: a chasing after the wind on an overcast day.  And there is a sadness that stews in these times of war, a deep empathy.  If I do not personally deal with this, I will be more likely to strike out, to war, against someone else.  So, I choose to paint.</p>
	<p>In painting some of these images out of focus, I am hoping to blur the line between &ldquo;us&rdquo; and &ldquo;them.&rdquo;  It is the &ldquo;us/them&rdquo; mentality that ignites war.  The idea that we are separate from each other is about ego and fear; this art is not about that.</p>
	<p>There is an intimate connection to humanity born when one honestly deals with death.  This series of paintings is part of my process, my war against war.  This is my way to dispel ghosts.  This is how I hope. </p></div>
